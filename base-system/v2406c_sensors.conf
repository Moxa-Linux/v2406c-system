# libsensors configuration file
# -----------------------------
#
# This default configuration file only includes statements which do not
# differ from one mainboard to the next. Only label, compute and set
# statements for internal voltage and temperature sensors are included.
#
# In general, local changes should not be added to this file, but rather
# placed in custom configuration files located in /etc/sensors.d. This
# approach makes further updates much easier.
#
# Such custom configuration files for specific mainboards can be found at
# http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/Configurations
#
# It is recommended not to modify this file, but to drop your local
# changes in /etc/sensors.d/. File with names that start with a dot
# are ignored.

# ltc4151 driver set 1 mOhm if not set via DT.
# according to HW spec, shunt-resistor is 20 mOhm
